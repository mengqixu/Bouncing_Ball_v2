# First Project for Expressive Computation
# Date: 2015/12/12

# In this project, I am trying to create four bouncing balls moving in given speed and the movement trails of them will generate a pattern.
# Based on Professor Lemasters comments, besides the four balls, another eraser ball and explosion effect are added. 
# The eraser ball will erase the some of the movements.
# And when two bouncing balls meet, there will be a explosion and exchang of color.
